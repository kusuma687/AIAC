        "Explanation:This code defines a function called convert_temperature that takes a temperature value, the unit it's currently in (like 'C' for Celsius, 'F' for Fahrenheit, or 'K' for Kelvin), and the unit you want to convert it to.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function first checks if the units you provided are valid. If they are, it converts the temperature to Celsius as an intermediate step. Then, it takes that Celsius value and converts it to the final unit you requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code also includes example uses of the function, showing how to convert temperatures between different units and printing the results. This demonstrates that the function can correctly handle various conversion scenarios."
